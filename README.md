## 🧠 How It Works

1. **SVG Animation**: The page opens with a bold "VI" logo animated using an SVG mask.
2. **Intro Sequence**: GSAP orchestrates a cinematic intro with scaling, rotation, and fade-out effects.
3. **Parallax Effects**: As users move the mouse, background and UI elements subtly shift to simulate depth.
4. **Animated Characters**: Elements like the character graphic slide in dynamically, creating an engaging entry.
5. **Section Transitions**: Smooth fade-ins, scroll-triggered reveals, and interactive CTAs.
6. **PS5 Branding**: Central PS5 logo used to enhance cinematic and thematic authenticity.
